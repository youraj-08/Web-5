SIMON'S GAME: Simon's game is a classic memory game that challenges players to remember and repeat a sequence of colors and sounds. The game consists of four colored buttons (red, green, blue, and yellow) that light up and play a sound when clicked. The game generates a random sequence of button presses for the player to repeat, and the sequence gets longer and more complex as the game progresses. The goal is to see how many sequences the player can successfully repeat without making a mistake.
